  // Notes:
  //
  //    These are 2-up, 3-up, 4-up and 5-up ULs suited for repeating blocks of content.
  //    Add 'mobile' to them to switch them just like the layout grid (one item per line) on phones
  //
  //    For IE7/8 compatibility, block-grid items need to be the same height.
  //    To support arbitrary height, set $support-block-grid-nth-child to true
  //    Just know that IE7/8 do not support :nth-child
